# Anonymous Giveaway App

A beautiful full-stack web application where users can anonymously enter giveaways and admins can manage them and pick random winners.

## Features

### For Users
- View all active giveaways
- Enter giveaways with one click (no signup required)
- See entry counts and winner status

### For Admins
- Create new giveaways with just a title
- View all giveaways with detailed stats
- Pick random winners from entries
- View winner information

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js with TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- React Router (routing)
- Axios (HTTP client)
- CSS (custom styling)

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express (web framework)
- LowDB (JSON file database)
- UUID (unique ID generation)
- CORS enabled

## Architecture

The app follows a clean client-server architecture:

### Backend (`/backend`)
- Express REST API server running on port 4000
- LowDB for persistent JSON file storage (`db.json`)
- Four main endpoints:
  - `GET /api/giveaways` - Fetch all giveaways
  - `POST /api/giveaways` - Create a new giveaway
  - `POST /api/giveaways/:id/enter` - Enter a giveaway
  - `POST /api/giveaways/:id/winner` - Pick a random winner

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- React SPA with TypeScript
- Two main routes:
  - `/` - User page (view and enter giveaways)
  - `/admin` - Admin page (create and manage giveaways)
- Responsive design with modern UI
- Real-time feedback with loading states

### Data Model
```typescript
{
  id: string,           // UUID
  title: string,        // Giveaway title
  entries: [            // Array of entries
    {
      id: string,       // Entry UUID
      enteredAt: string // ISO timestamp
    }
  ],
  winner: {             // Winner object (null if not picked)
    entryId: string,    // Winning entry ID
    pickedAt: string    // ISO timestamp
  },
  createdAt: string     // ISO timestamp
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation & Running

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start or npm run dev
```

The backend server will start on `https://giveawayapplicationbackend-1.onrender.com`

#### Frontend

The frontend will start on (https://giveawayapplicationbackend.onrender.com)




## What I'd Improve With More Time

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Add proper admin authentication
   - Prevent users from entering the same giveaway multiple times (using cookies/sessions)
   - Add user profiles

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add giveaway descriptions and images
   - Set end dates for giveaways
   - Email notifications for winners
   - Export winner data
   - Search and filter giveaways

3. **Database & Performance**
   - Migrate to a production database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
   - Add caching layer (Redis)
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add database indexes

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend API endpoints
   - Integration tests for the full flow
   - E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
   - Component tests for React components

5. **DevOps & Production**
   - Docker containerization
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Production deployment setup
   - Monitoring and logging

6. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Better mobile experience
   - Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Toast notifications instead of message boxes

7. **Security**
   - Rate limiting on API endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Security headers
